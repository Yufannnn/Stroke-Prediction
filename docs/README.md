**Q: What factors does the tool consider for prediction?**  
A: The tool considers various factors such as age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, marital status, work type, residence type, average glucose level, BMI, and smoking status.

**Q: Why is it that sometimes the tool gives a 50% prediction?**  
A: A 50% prediction means the model is indeterminate and cannot make a clear decision based on the provided information. It suggests that the factors entered may not strongly lean towards or against the likelihood of a stroke.

Certainly, here's a revised answer for that question:

**Q: I received a high-risk result. What should I do next?**  
A: If you receive a high-risk result or are concerned about your results, it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional immediately. They can provide a comprehensive assessment and guide you on potential next steps. It's important to note that the Stroke Prediction Tool is a simple model built based on a limited dataset and should be used as a reference only.

**Q: Is my data stored or shared when using this tool?**  
A: No. We prioritize your privacy. The data you input is only used for prediction and is not stored or shared with any third parties.

**Q: How can I improve my results or lower my risk?**  
A: Leading a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, a balanced diet, avoiding smoking, and regular medical check-ups can potentially reduce the risk of stroke. However, always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
